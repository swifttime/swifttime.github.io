Time 4 Swift!
=============

This is a new blog devoted to developers' experiences with Apple's new programming language Swift.

This blog, the associated organization [github.com/swifttime](https://github.com/swifttime), and
    our Twitter feed [@time4swift](http://twitter.com/time4swft) make up a journey down the 
    path of learning something new. If we ever stop enjoying learning, it's "Game over, man." <sub>(Hudson, Aliens, 1986)</sub>

So join us on our journey into coding excellence.

Be well,
Rick
